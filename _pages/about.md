Hi!

I am studying under both the Bachelor and the Master’s program in Computer Science at Stanford University with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence.

My interests are in deep learning, natural language processing, and AR/VR assistants. I have worked at FPT.AI, Dragon Labs, and am currently working at the Stanford Open Virtual Assistant Lab.

In my free time, I love playing sports, reading books, and exploring new opportunities. I love making new friends too so please do not hesitate if you want to get in touch!
