Welcome to Shiba Codes!

This is a tech blog, written by Hung Bui - a current Stanford University Bachelor and Master's student. 

While focusing on tech, the blog will occasionally feature content from other domains. The posts will be tagged for ease of searching and finding the right subjects. 

Please do not hesitate to reach out if you want to connect or if you have any question! I am always looking to make new friends!
